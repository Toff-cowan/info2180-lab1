        <p>Yup. Thats my name right up there. Just your average guy aiming to be an above average...some might even say
        overaverage. I love playing video games, watch movies and anime, and coding of course. I also like to read books, but I don't
        do that as often as I should. I love the word of God and try to lead a life befitting to Christ. My favorite movie is black panther, but I have a lot of favorite movies. My
        favorite video game is probably Apex Legends. I really resonate with the anime One Piece and draw some level of inspiration from Luffy and his crew. I also love to cook. 
        
        I like build websites and found it to something I am pretty good at, thsi isnt my first website, but hoping this course elevates my skills a bit further to deliver a great service to my clients.    

        Some might say my dream is vague, but I would say is it sums up everything I want to achieve is one word. I want to be... 
        the greatest to ever do it. You'd just have to stic around to know what I mean.  Thats all, Ciao!</p>
